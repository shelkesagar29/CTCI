# CTCI
Python solutions to the "Cracking The Coding Interview" book.

# Solutions
1. I have tried my best to keep solution structure unform as per given in template.py file.
2. Data structure on which chapter is based off is implemented and saved in DS folder.
3. Multiple solutions with different time and space complexity are given for each problem.
4. Python standard libraries are used as minimum as possible.

# Testing
1. For each solution, unit tests are written. 
2. Python unittest framework is used to write test cases.
3. Each test is independent.

# Contributions
1. Solutions implemented in different languages are welcome.
2. If you are submitting python solution, please first check whether it is really different from current solutions.
